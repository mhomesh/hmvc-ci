# Download the zip files to your local system and extract files.
Download all 3 directories
Copy files and folders inside the application direcotory of you Codeigniter application.

Make sure you have place the directories to the right place and your HMVC is all set
#After setting up HMVC you can run you project from module directory.
for example : yourdomain.com/controller/function/
In our case I  have created Welcome controller inside the Modules so the url will be
